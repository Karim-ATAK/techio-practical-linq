# Using C# LINQ - A Practical Overview

This course is designed as an introduction to using LINQ in the C# language.

### Who Will the Course Benefit?
 - C# developers who want to learn more about LINQ
 - Developers who may not know much C# but want to get a preview of some of the more powerful language features

### Course Content
This course starts out by explaining LINQ: what it is and where you would use it. It then introduces students to about 25 different LINQ methods. Similar methods are grouped together to aid comprehension and retention.

### Related Courses
There are two other supplementary LINQ courses designed to be taken in conjunction with this course:
 - **C# LINQ Background Topics**
 - **C# LINQ Advanced Topics**

Neither supplementary course is required for the **Using C# LINQ** course. You may want to take the **Background** course before (or after) this one, but it is only recommended for advanced programmers. Beginners may be confused by some of the content.

The **Advanced** course should be taken after the **Using** course, but beginning programmers might want to skip this course as well. It is not required to be able to use LINQ in most situations.

### Previous Knowledge
The lessons provided here are geared towards beginner to intermediate programmers. Students should have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of C#. Required skills include crafting of classes, fields, and methods. A good understanding of C# data types is also strongly recommended.
