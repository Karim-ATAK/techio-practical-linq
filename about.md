# C# LINQ Overview

This course is designed as an in-depth study of LINQ for programmers who are already familiar with C#.

### Who Will the Course Benefit?
 - Developers who have been using C# for a while, but haven't tried LINQ yet
 - Developers who have used LINQ but don't completely understand it
 - Experienced developers who may not know much C# but want to get a preview of some of the more powerful language features

### Course Content
The lesson plan starts out with some Background material, followed by some introductory LINQ concepts. It then discusses several commonly used LINQ commands in more detail, and finishes up with an Advanced Topics section that gives some hints and precautions for how to get the most out of LINQ while avoiding some of the pitfalls.

### Customizable Content
This LINQ overview is designed to be somewhat customizable. Students who are only looking for basic exposure to LINQ can just skim, or even completely skip, the Background and Advanced Topics sections. Or, if you're dying to jump into the practical material, then do the Background section last.
