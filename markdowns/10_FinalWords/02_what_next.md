# What next?
So now that we've opened the door a crack, what's the next step? There are several directions you can go from here...

# Reinforcing
Here are some other resources you can tap into to reinforce the information covered in this course.

### Practical LINQ (Pluralsight)
Pluralsight is an excellent online training site. It offers a large number of .NET courses on a wide variety of topics, presented by very knowledgeable developers. Pluralsight is a paid resource, but if you are serious about learning .NET, then I think it is well worth the money.

The [Practical LINQ](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-linq/table-of-contents) course, by Deborah Kurata, is very well presented and goes over much of the same material as the course you have just completed.

### 101 LINQ Samples
[101 LINQ Samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/101-LINQ-Samples-3fb9811b) is a set of Visual Studio solutions, provided by the Visual Studio Product Team, designed to illustrate LINQ usage. They can be opened using the free [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) IDE, and provide a great method to explore LINQ.

### CondinGame puzzles
The [CodinGame](http://www.codingame.com) website provides a large suite of programming puzzles that can be solved in many languages. Here is a list of puzzles that lend themselves to a completely (or mostly) LINQ-based solution. See if you can figure them out.

 - [Temperatures](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures)
 - [Minimal Number of Swaps](https://www.codingame.com/training/community/minimal-number-of-swaps)
 - [The Beautiful Sequence](https://www.codingame.com/training/community/the-beautiful-sequence)
 - [The Fastest](https://www.codingame.com/training/community/the-fastest)
 - [Gravity Tumbler](https://www.codingame.com/training/community/gravity-tumbler)

### LINQPad
[LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net) is a Windows application that lets you experiment with LINQ queries in a nice GUI environment. It requires a connection to a datasource, which requires some knowledge to setup, but if you are willing to take the time to do so, it can be a rewarding learning experience.

# Expansion
Here are some resources to expand your knowledge of LINQ. They build on the information introduced in the course you have just completed.

### C# LINQ Background Topics
This **tech.io** course is designed to augment the information contained in the course you have just completed. It goes into more detail on things such as delegates, the `IEnumerable<T>` interface, and extension methods.

**Link to course TBD**

### C# LINQ Advanced Topics
This **tech.io** course is also designed to augment the information contained in the course you have just completed. It provides some hints and precautions for how to get the most out of LINQ while avoiding some of its pitfalls. If you haven't already, you should take the **Background Topics** course before moving on to **Advanced Topics**.

### More Effective LINQ (Pluralsight)
The [More Effective LINQ](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linq-more-effective/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course, by Mark Heath, introduces more advanced LINQ usage patterns. It also gives some good information on LINQ performance and debugging.

### LINQ Architecture (Pluralsight)
[LINQ Architecture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linq-architecture/table-of-contents) is another Pluralsight course, this time by Scott Allen. It is a quick watch, and provides a lot of good ideas for what can be done in C# with the concepts introduced with LINQ.
