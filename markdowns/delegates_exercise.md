# Exercise: Delegates

In the previous lessons, we learned how to declare delegate types, and how to pass method references as function parameters using delegates.

In this exercise, you must pass either a delegate to a method call or a lambda expression to the `TestSayHello()` function in order to produce the desired results. This delegate takes a single `string` argument and returns a `string` result.
