# Background Topics - Introduction

Yes, there is an entire course on [LINQ Background Topics](https://tech.io/playgrounds/345). Why do we need a section here on background topics?

The **Background** course is advanced material and takes a deep-dive approach to subjects such as: delegates, generators, and extension methods. On the other hand, this background chapter is intended for beginners. It is for those students who have little or no knowledge of lambda expressions, generics, etc.

A very basic understanding of these concepts is pretty much required to effectively use LINQ. If you already are familiar with this material or you have already taken the **Background Topics** course, you can probably skim through or even skip this chapter.
