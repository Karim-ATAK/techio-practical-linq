# Background Topics - Introduction

Yes, there is an entire course on **LINQ Background Topics**. Why do we need a section here on background topics?

The **Background** course is advanced material, and takes a deep-dive approach to subjects such as delegates, generators, and extension methods. This background chapter is, on the other hand, intended for beginners. It is for those who have little or no knowledge of things such as lambda expressions and generics.

A very basic understanding of these concepts is pretty much required to effectively use LINQ. If you already are familiar with this material, or if you have already taken the **Background Topics** course, then you can probably skim or even skip this chapter.
