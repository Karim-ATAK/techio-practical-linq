# Introduction

The C# programming language is quite popular with developers, in large part because of its many powerful and intuitive language features. One of these impressive (and fun, in a nerdy way) features is LINQ.

### LINQ != SQL
The acronym LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query, and LINQ syntax is very roughly based on SQL. Newcomers to C# often misinterpret this to mean that LINQ is a database access API. It is true that LINQ was conceived as a way to access the data in a database from code, and that it maintains that functionality. But that is not the extent of its utility.


### The LINQ paradigm
The LINQ paradigm describes a method for programmatically accessing and manipulating any data, independent of source. There are many implementations of LINQ, each written to access a different kind of datasource. Some common ones are LINQ to SQL, LINQ to XML, and LINQ to Objects.

### LINQ to Objects
This course is strictly concerned with that last one, LINQ to Objects, though many of the concepts learned here can be applied to other LINQ implementations. LINQ to Objects provides access to data stored in C# collections such as lists and arrays.
