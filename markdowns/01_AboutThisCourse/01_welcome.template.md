# Using C# LINQ - A Practical Overview
Welcome to **Using C# LINQ**. This course is designed as an introduction to LINQ for programmers who are already familiar with the C# language (or perhaps another C-like language such as C++ or Java).

The lesson plan starts out by explaining LINQ: what it is and where you would use it. It then introduces students to about 25 different LINQ methods. Similar methods are grouped together to aid comprehension and retention.

The LINQ methods discussed in this course are some of the simpler and / or more commonly used methods, based on my own experience. There are other very powerful LINQ methods that are not addressed here, because I consider them to be either too obscure or too complicated for this overview. You are encouraged to explore these other options on your own.

### Supplementary courses
There are two supplementary LINQ courses designed to be taken in conjunction with this course:
 - **C# LINQ Background Topics**
 - **C# LINQ Advanced Topics**

Neither supplementary course is required for the **Using C# LINQ** course. You may want to take the **Background** course before (or after) this one, but it is only recommended for advanced programmers. Beginners may be confused by some of the content.

The **Advanced** course provides some hints and precautions for how to get the most out of LINQ while avoiding some of its pitfalls. It should be taken after the **Using** course, but beginning programmers might want to skip this course as well. The **Advanced** course is not required to be able to use LINQ in most situations.
