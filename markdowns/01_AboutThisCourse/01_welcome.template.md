# C# LINQ Overview
Welcome to **C# LINQ Overview**. This course is designed as an in-depth study of LINQ for programmers who are already familiar with the C# language.

The lesson plan starts out with some Background material, followed by some introductory LINQ concepts. It then discusses several commonly used LINQ commands in more detail, and finishes up with an Advanced Topics section, providing some hints and precautions for how to get the most out of LINQ while avoiding some of the pitfalls.

### Customizable Content
Feel free to customize this course to match your learning style. Students who are only looking for basic exposure to LINQ can just skim, or even completely skip, the Background and Advanced Topics sections. Or, if you're dying to jump into the practical material, then do the Background section last.

> Don't get discouraged. The first **Background** chapters are pretty heavy material. Familiarity with the concepts in this section will give you a much fuller understanding of LINQ, but isn't required to use it.
