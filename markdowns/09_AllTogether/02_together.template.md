# Combined Exercise #2

Let's do one more!

In this exercise, combine LINQ method calls together to do the following:
 - Reduce the provided list of words to only those that contain the lower-case letter 'e' in them
 - Sort the resulting list by alphabetical order
 - Obtain the last word in the sorted list
 - Return the string, "The last word is &lt;word&gt;", using the last word from the sorted list
 - If the sorted list is empty, return `null`
